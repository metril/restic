Bugfix: Correct `--no-lock` handling of `ls` and `tag` command

The `ls` command never locked the repository. This has been fixed. The old
behavior is still supported using `ls --no-lock`. The latter invocation also
works with older restic versions.

The `tag` command erroneously accepted the `--no-lock` command. The command
now always requires an exclusive lock.
