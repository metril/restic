Enhancement: (alpha) Store deviceID only for hardlinks

Set `RESTIC_FEATURES=device-id-for-hardlinks` to enable this alpha feature.
The feature flag will be removed after repository format version 3 becomes
available or be replaced with a different solution.

When creating backups from a filesystem snapshot, for example created using
btrfs subvolumes, the deviceID of the filesystem changes compared to previous
snapshots. This prevented restic from deduplicating the directory metadata of
a snapshot.

When this alpha feature is enabled, then the deviceID is only stored for
hardlinks. This significantly reduces the metadata duplication for most
backups.
